# GeoAI Application

![GeoAI Logo](/path/to/geoai-logo.png)

## Overview

GeoAI is an application aimed at integrating artificial intelligence to address climate change and health issues. The application features three main components: an interactive web map, a weather forecast feature, and a WhatsApp chatbot. These components work together to provide users with valuable insights into flood risk areas, weather conditions, and access to a conversational agent for real-time information.

## Features

### 1. Interactive Web Map

The interactive web map is designed to display water index maps, hospitals, and schools. This feature aids in visualizing flood risk areas and understanding the distribution of critical infrastructure. Users can interact with the map to explore different layers and gain valuable insights into the geographical aspects of flood-prone regions.

#### How to Use the Web Map:

- Navigate to the "Map" section on the GeoAI website.
- Use the interactive controls to toggle between water index maps, hospitals, and schools.
- Zoom in and out to explore specific regions and locations.

### 2. Weather Forecast Feature

The weather forecast feature provides users with up-to-date weather information, helping them stay informed about current and upcoming weather conditions. This feature is crucial for individuals and communities in assessing potential climate-related risks.

#### How to Access Weather Forecasts:

- Go to the "Weather" section on the GeoAI website.
- View real-time weather updates, including temperature, precipitation, and wind conditions.

### 3. WhatsApp Bot

GeoAI includes a WhatsApp chatbot that users can engage with for instant information and assistance. While the bot is not embedded directly on the site, a link is provided for users to initiate a conversation on their mobile devices.

#### How to Chat with the WhatsApp Bot:

- Click on the "Chat with GeoAI Bot" link on the GeoAI website.
- Open the link on your mobile device to start a conversation with the WhatsApp chatbot.

## Installation

The GeoAI application is a web-based platform and does not require any installation. Users can access the application through a web browser on their desktop or mobile devices.

## Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Internet connection for real-time updates and data retrieval
